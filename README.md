## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
- Seems easy enough but I forgot that you can adjust the line heights this easily...

```css
.description{line-height: 3vh;}
```

### Continued development
- Responsive web dev as the mobile version doesn't show the image both in portrait and landscape modes even though the desktop version works fine and I made the mobile version using the developer tools to test responsiveness :slightly_frowning_face:
- I would like to experience using different fonts as I had some trouble linking the fonts and making the text look right at the start
- To keep practising!
